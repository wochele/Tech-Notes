# Getting Started with the Amazon Product Advertising API

---

The Amazon Product Advertising API allows you to access product information and searches from your website. From there, you can dynamically create content which is more descriptive of the product (such as
the current price) and blends better with your site. 

### Signing up for the API 

- Start your API journey here:
    - *[Amazon Product Advertising API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html?ac-ms-src=ac-nav)*
- Click the *Sign Up Now* button at the top right of the page and sign in with your Amazon.com credentials
- On the next page, verify your contact and site info, then agree to the terms and conditions you are not going to read. You're in!

### Creating an API key

In order to get information back from the API, you'll need to create an authentication key here:

*[AWS Security Credentials Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?rw_useCurrentProtocol=1#security_credential)*

- Log on and click *Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)* 
- Click *Create New Access Key* and click *Show Access Key*. Copy the information in a safe place and don't lose it. This will be used to call the API. 

### Calling the API 

The API can provide up-to-date information about a product such as price, reviews, description, etc. Programming languages Java, C#, PHP and Perl are generally used to create the pages with the API. Other languages
supporting REST API calls can be used, but there are no code examples for them in the documentation. The following page documents making your first request:

*[Submitting Your First Request in Product Advertising API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/GSG/SubmittingYourFirstRequest.html)*

To test calls to the API, use the API scratch pad here:
