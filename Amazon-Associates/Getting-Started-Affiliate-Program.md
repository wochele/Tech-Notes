# Getting Started with Amazon Associates Affiliate Program

---

At the core, all the Amazon Associates program does is provide a way for you to encourage people to click a link to Amazon.com and buy stuff. If they buy something while they are there, then
you get a share of the purchase (an advertising fee). This could be a link on your blog, twitter, or an email. Depending on the traffic to your site, you could create a substantial revenue stream by referring
users to products on Amazon.com. 

### Sign up on the Amazon Associates site

- Start your affiliate journey by clicking the following link:
    - *[Amazon Associates Affiliate Program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/)*
- Before you go clicking the **Join Now for Free** button, take a moment to read all about what you are getting into. Ok, you can click it now.
- Once you click it, you'll be presented with the Amazon.com logon screen. Go ahead and logon with your Amazon.com credentials. I'll wait. 
- Once you are logged in, choose who you want all the money sent to. I chose myself. You can choose me too if you want. 
- On the next screen, you'll need to add the website(s) you will be referring links from. 
- Now you'll need to fill out the profile for your website. I know it's a lot to fill out, but think of all the $ you'll be making soon. 
- Once that's done, you'll need to be identified via your telephone # and agree to a bunch of terms and conditions (you can read them for me).
- You are now done and have the option to enter your tax info now. 
- A 180 day clock is now ticking for you to get your first sale or Amazon will yank your application. Go get selling!

### Ways to refer people back to Amazon.com 

- Including links to Amazon.com products on your website, tweets, email, etc
    - As an affiliate, a stripe will appear on Amazon.com as you shop. When you find an item you would like to link to, you can get the link right on the stripe. You have the choice of text, 
    image or text+image. Pick one and copy the code for use on your page. 
    - The *[Product Links](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/build-links/individual/main.html?ac-ms-src=ac-nav)* page allows you to search for products and use a tool 
    to customize the look of your links. 
    - The *[Banner Links](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/build-links/banner/main.html?ac-ms-src=ac-nav)* tool helps you make some of those cool banners that everybody 
    on the internet loves. 
    - *[Native Shopping Ads](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/home/ads?ac-ms-src=ac-nav)* helps you build compelling ads which look a little bit more stylish. 
    - *[Mobile Popover](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/mobile-popover/main.html?ac-ms-src=ac-nav)* puts ads at the bottom of the screen that gently scroll up as the user does. 
    - The *[aStore](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/store/main.html?ac-ms-src=ac-nav)* lets you create your own store with products on Amazon.com. 
    - *[Featured Promotions and Bounties](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/promo-hub/promo.html?ac-ms-src=ac-nav-1)* are special offers such as referring a user to try Prime and make a set commission.
    
### Amazon Product Advertising API

To take your Amazon.com product linking to the next level, it's time to sign up for the product advertising API. With the API, you can dynamically access product information and searches right from 
your own website to incorporate natively in your content. I detail starting with the API in the following post:
