# Setting up Powershell on a new system

- [Install chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/)
- [Set up the console flair](https://github.com/wochele/Tech-Notes/blob/master/Powershell/Console/Customize-the-Console.md)
- `install-package PowershellCookbook -AllowClobber`
  - Installs `Show-Object` which is great for showing complicated objects vs. Get-Member
