# Tuple data type

- Are immutable lists
- Denoted by using parenthesis to create
- If you have only one value in your tuple, you can indicate this by placing a trailing comma after the value inside the parentheses. Otherwise, Python will think youâ€™ve just typed a value inside regular parentheses.
- If you need an ordered sequence of values that never changes, use a tuple.
- Python can implement some optimizations that make code using tuples slightly faster than code using lists.
