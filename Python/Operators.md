# Operators

### Comparison Operators

- == Equal to
- != Not equal to
- < Less than
- > Greater than
- <= Less than or equal to
- >=Greater than or equal to

### The `not` operator

Unlike and and or, the not operator operates on only one Boolean value (or expression). The not operator simply evaluates to the opposite Boolean value.

### Augmented assignment operators

- `spam = spam + 1` | `spam += 1`
- `spam = spam - 1` | `spam -= 1`
- `spam = spam * 1` | `spam *= 1`
- `spam = spam / 1` | `spam /= 1`
- `spam = spam % 1` | `spam %= 1`
